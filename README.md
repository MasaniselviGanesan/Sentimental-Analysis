  # ✈️ Sentimental Analysis on Airline Tweets

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently in-progress and under active development. Some features and results are still being implemented and finalized.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM) to classify airline-related tweets into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments. It’s being developed in **multiple phases**, with comparisons at each stage.
